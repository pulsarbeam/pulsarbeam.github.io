  <p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br>
    Emotional intelligence (EQ) is how a person perceives, controls, evaluates, and expresses emotions. It is not based on your IQ, Its based on how you reacted to your own emotions and how you react to other peoples emotions. Being able to judge and understand what people are feeling in a certain situation is EQ along with using our emotions to help social communication, It is also how we control our own feelings and emotions. EQ is also how we relate to others.

<p><strong>How is EQ different to IQ</strong><br>

  Emotional quotient is the measure of emotional competency while IQ is the measure of your cognitive abilities, how you process non-emotional questions and your memory.
  EQ is measured through a self report measuring their own feelings, thoughts and behaviours.
  IQ is measured by assessing a person cognitive ability.</p>

<p><strong>Why is EQ Important</strong><br>
  IQ has always been viewed as the main determinant of success, but after some time it has been shown that having a high IQ does not mean you will be successful. People have realised that the IQ test does not encompass the full range of humans abilities and thus EQ was formed. People with higher EQ tend to have stronger leadership potential, which means they are good managers and business leaders. Having a high EQ can make you more trusting to others and make people feel calmer in your presence, it is shown that is people trust and like you they are more likely to pay more for a lower quality product compared to a person they donâ€™t trust and like.<br>
  Having a high EQ helps you build relationships. reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction, this is what makes EQ so important in life and the workplace.
