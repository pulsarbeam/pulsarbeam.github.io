  <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
  <div class="align-left">
  <p><strong><u>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</u></strong><br>
   <ul>
    <li>NeuroPlasticity and growth mindset have been crucial for me to develop the coding skills I have learnt throughout this foundations course</li>
    <li>I have learnt that my emotions can take over sometimes and hinder my learning journey I have to remember coding is hard and I cant become frustrated if something doesnt go my way</li>
    <li>I have also learnt how to be paitent I realize I can be an impatient perosn but sometimes you just need to take your time to solve a problem and go over everything slowly</li>   
  </ul>
</p>
  
<p><strong><u>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</u></strong><br>
  Values in programming are relaly important because it has a steep learning curve you must have a strong value to learn and dedicate a lot of time to learning a new skill. You have to have empathy for yourself and others when you dont understand problems.
  Working in programming involves a lot of team work to solve a problems so you need to empthetic to others and so you share that same values. You need to be self-aware of how you act towards others since you are working in a team a lot of the time you need to see how your actions affect others and how you can improve yourtself constantly. </p>
  
  <p><strong><u>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</u></strong><br>
  Probably NeuroPlasticity and growth mindset its amazing how you never stop learning but only if you tell yourself that, if you tell yourself you cant learn anymore you wont, but if you change your mindest you can learn anything.</p>
  
  <p><strong><u>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u></strong><br>
    Writing the blog posts, I find it difficult to write about the core learning sometimes but it has been good for me to learn.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong><u>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</u></strong><br>
   because a lot of programmers lack these core skills to get jobs, but lots of recruiters are looking for these core skills to see if you will work in a team well.</p>
 
    <p><strong><u>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</u></strong><br>
    This was definitly somthing I thought was a waste of time at the start of the course but the more we went thorugh foundations I realised how important it is to develop thse core skills that the development world is missing.
