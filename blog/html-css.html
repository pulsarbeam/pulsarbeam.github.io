  <h1><strong>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</strong></h1>
  <p><strong>What is an id and class?</strong><br>
  An id and a class are called attributes, they are used in CSS to give elements in an HTML document a style specified by the attribute.<br>You can think of id's and classes as selectors for the type of style an element wants to use.
  
<p><strong>How to use id and class?</strong><br>
To use an id in your CSS sheet use the '#' followed by the id name then using curly brackets to define.<br>
To use a class in your CSS sheet use the '.' followed by the class name then using curly brackets to define</p>

  <p><strong>What is the difference between and id and a class?</strong><br>
  You may be thinking how class and id attributes differ from one another as they seem pretty familiar.<br>
    An id attribute can only be used by one HTML element within the page, while a class can be used by multipule HTML elements.<br>
    <strong>Note - If you use an id and a class in the same element an id will overide the class style.</strong>
  </p>

<p><strong>When should you use classes vs id's?</strong><br>
If you think there is going to be more than one element which requires the same style you should always use a class</p>

<p><strong>What are best practices?</strong><br>
  There is not a specific reason to use an id over a class but its best practice to only use idâ€™s if you want a style to apply to one element on the webpage and use a class when you want to style multiple elements throughout the site.<br>
  A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on a page.</p>
