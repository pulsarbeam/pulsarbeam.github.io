<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
      <p>Im proud of completing two half marathons last year, even though my goal was a full marathon I was still really proud of myself for the progress I had made and the dedication to train for it. It taught me that I truly can do something if you put your mind to it as i have always doubted myself on achieving goals but training for the half marathons showed i can have dedication.</p>

 <p>1. An ethical decision I have made is becoming Vegan over 2 years ago, This has probably been one of the biggest changes in my life, it makes me think about all the choices we make everyday and how it might effect others. It makes me appreciate life so much more and I feel more connected to nature. It gives me motivation to better myself everyday and prove to people that you can survive and thrive on a plant-based diet. Ive have always found it hard to have discussions with people about being plant-based but I have found myself having friendly discussions about my choices and they are almost always positive, which in turn have made me a better person to talk to.</p>

<p>2. My family have always said treat people how you would like to be treated and I believe I have stuck to that as I cant expect people to treat me            how id like to unless I reciprocate the respect I would like.</p>

<p>3. According to my personality test I am a logician which means i have a unique perspective, open minded, analytical, curious and objective. I think all these traits will help me think like a programmer as programming is logical and objective, and requires out of the box thinking sometimes.</p>
<p>4. I think my biggest limitation is self doubt, If I feel like I cant understand something after a while I sometimes give up but devacadmey have taught me just in time learning which gives me the confidence and helps me not doubt myself, I can also be impatient  which might hurt my learning journey along with being a perfectionist. Being impatient and perfectionist sometimes doesnâ€™t go well together because I can struggle to move on with things if they are not perfect but then I also can become inpatient with how long it takes.</p>

<p>5. In my previous job I was an electrician, having to work with small and big teams constantly taught me a lot, I used to work on my own a lot at a factory that does plastic moulding. I never understood how the machines worked and what exactly the problems were, i never use to ask for help because I felt dumb for not understanding. This made me very inefficient and slow and solving problems. But after a while I understood what worked better was working with the operators of the machines as they understood them much more than me. Even though they were constantly busy instead of me diving head first and trying to solve the problem, I would talk to the operators first. I extracted as much information as possible from them and got there opinions on what might be wrong before even looking at the machine. I found this made me wary more effective in my job and kept my boss happy.</p>
