  <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
  <div class="align-left">
    <p><strong>What is Javascripts relation to HTML and CSS?
    </strong><br>
    Javascript is an advanced programming language that makes web pages more interactive, HTML is a markup language that provides the primary structure for the website,  Javascript, CSS and HTML are all interconnected via the DOM via the DOM Javascript can interact with html and css to provide scripts and make it more interactive. HTML provides structure for the content, CSS makes it pretty and user friendly, Javascript response to user  behaviour.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Control Flow and Loops</strong><br>
    control flow is how your code run code from top to bottom unless it hits any conditionals such as loops or functions. control flow is like your routine everyday you start by doing something like making breakfast then in the evening you make dinner, its always this way control flow always goes from top (morning) to bottom (afternoon)

    Loops repeat until a specified condition is meet, in everyday life you could thing of a music playlist going through the playlist until itâ€™s done. Or like hanging out washing you repeat putting clothes up until the basket is empty.
  </p>
<p><strong>What is the DOM?</strong><br>
  The DOM stands for the Document Object Model and its how you use Javascript to modify a website the document is HTML the object stands for how javascript uses html it turns and html document into a javascript object and model is how the html document is the real thing and javascript has its own model own model of the html document.</p>
<p>An example of using the DOM might be if you have an empty or full shopping cart you want a checkout button when clicked to say your cart is empty if its empty or take you to the checkout page if something is in your cart.</p>
<p><strong>Arrays vs Objects</strong><br>
  Objects are used to represent things in your code anything that can be defined by a set of characteristics, these are called properties and consist of a key and a value. To access these properties we use either dot or bracket notation</p>  
<p>Like This</p>

<p>We use arrays when we want to store a list of multiples items in a single variable they can be useful when creating ordered list as items in the list can be accessed by their numerical values.
  Arrays use zero-based indexing so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the next item will have and index of 1 and so on
   </p>

<p>Objects represent things with properties while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. 
</p>
<p><strong>What Are Functions?</strong><br>
  Functions are a block of reusable code written to perform tasks. A function consists of a set of statements but executes as a single unit.
  to use a function you need to use the function keyword followed by the name of the function, parentheses, and the body of the function wrapped in curly brackets.
  </p>
  <img src="images/Functions.png" alt="Arrays Code" style="width:500px;">
<p>As you can see from this example functions could be helpful if you needed to log those greetings multiple times, instead of logging them every time you just call the function which says time and makes code less confusing.
