      <h1>Rene's Learning Plan</h1>
    
      
        <p>As a long term goal i would like to become a web developer working for a company with lots of learning and career growth opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>A strengh I have is i'm really good at sticking to a routine and being persistent when it comes to study. <br>
        A limitation is my ability to retain information sometimes. I tend to forget stuff that i learn and have to go back over things a few times which sometimes I can find frustrating.</p>
      <p>I tend to a pretty quiet and shy person, so some development to be a bit more confident would be nice. I tend to work well with a small group of people once i get to know them.</p>
      <p>I think just being open to everyone about what im doing and what im struggling with and asking others for help when needed, I will also be extremely happy to help others if they are struggling on a certain aspect as it will help me learn as well.<br>
      If things are really getting to me i step away form what im doing and go for a walk or meditate to calm my mind, I find i overthink things sometimes and when i clear my head and come back i can take everything better.
      </p>
     <p>I think I realise the support i have from the facilitators at dev academy they are all friendly so if i need help with anything im not worried about asking them for help.</p>
      <p>I expect the team to be helpful and kind when i need help but also supportive on my learning journey
      </p>
    <p>During the bootcamp i may need to go to an appointment as i broke my wrist on the 18th January and will need to get the cast checked/removed at some point but i will keep the facilitators updated. This will also slow down my typing speed so hopefully it won't effect me to much.
