 <h1>NeuroPlasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
 <div class="align-left">
  <p><strong>How does understanding neuroplasticity benefit people?
  </strong><br>Neuroplasticity is the ability of how neural networks in the brain change through the actions you do. It is how to he brain rewires itself to learning new things and changes from the way is previously functioned.
<br>In knowing how neuroplasticity works it may help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being, no matter how old you are our brain is constantly growing, simply making the neurones stronger is places you use them more and less in the places we use them less. 
</p>
<p><strong>How might I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity</strong><br>
  Learning about neuroplasticity for me is really important as it shows me whatever age you are you can still learn and it’s what the brain is designed to do, it’s not ‘fixed’ after a certain age. From what I have learned to get the most out of neuroplasticity you need to practice what you are learning as regular as possible, so I will practice coding everyday to help build those neural pathways in my brain</p>
 
<p><strong>How to increase neuroplasticity
</strong><br>
There are a number of ways to increase neuroplasticity. exercising regularly helps improve neuroplasticity, eating a healthy diet with lots of good omega-3 fatty acids have shown to improve cognition, and just learning something new is a good way to improve neuroplasticity, such as learning or learning a new language, new experiences also increase neuroplasticity. Mindfulness also plays a key role in neuroplasticity.

<p><strong>
  What is Growth Mindset</strong><br>
  Growth mindset is how we think and tackle challenges, a growth mindset means that you believe your talents and intelligence can be developed over time, whereas a fixed mindset means you believe intelligence if fixed, so if you believe you are not good at something, you might never believe you will be good at it.</p>

<p><strong>What Surprised you Learning about growth mindset?
</strong><br>
What surprised me during my research was a study they did were they got two different groups of people to learn to play piano. One group learned to play piano normally, the other simply sat at the piano and thought about playing it. Although the people who didn’t play the piano weren’t as good as the people who actually played the piano, they quickly caught up<br>
I found this really surprising as it shows how you think about anything affects you so having a fixed mindset is not a good way to learn new things, everyone has a growth mindset it just about changing the narrative in your head.</p>

<p><strong>
  How will you Integrate Growth Mindset into your Learning Journey?</strong><br>
  I think learning about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset have really helped me understand if you put your mind to anything you can do it. Our brains are not fixed they are made to grow throughout our whole life, its has really encouraged me to believe in myself. It will help me learn and be more motivated.
