  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <div class="align-left">
  <p><strong><u>Simple Problem I Was Blocked on.</u></strong><br>
    I got stuck on grade book question 3, I could not figure out how to assign the value of the testScores to equal the students scores in the scores array, <br>
    I mainly used google to figure out how to solve the problem, Also trying a whole bunch of different ideas I had, but in the end google helped me with the answer. Reading the error messages also helped me understand what was wrong.<br>
    I felt frustrated throughout the process because I knew it was simple but I couldnt get it.<br>
  I learned that I overthink most things and I sometimes need to take a break and not get tunnel vision sometimes I need to step back and have a break and come back.
</p>
  
<p><strong><u>Elegantly Solved Problem</u></strong><br>
    I enjoyed the first super fizzbuzz  problem. First using google I figured out I could use the modulo operator to get the remainder of a number,  then using if else statements I could return a string if the remainder of a number is 0.
    <br>
    This was probably one of the only problems that went smoothly for me, it felt elegant and easy to understand. I learnt that problems sometimes arenâ€™t as complicated as you think. the solution felt elegant and simple to understand.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong><u>Problem Solving Techniques</u></strong><br></p>
  
  <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong><br>
    I used pseudocode a little bit throughout these challenges but its something I need to use more because it helps breakdown problems into smaller steps.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Trying Something</strong><br>
    I used this a lot as you can try so many different things and read error messages go back and try something else it was really helpful. Then you can also console.log the problem and try something else.</p>
 
    <p><strong>Googling</strong><br>
    This was defiantly my most used technique throughout these challenges. websites like stack overflow can really help you understand problems and help break things down for you, im getting better at asking google the right questions.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Asking peers and coaches for help</strong><br>
    I havent used this yet but I should because the teachers are really helpful and the students seem nice as well but I'm still not feeling to confident with this one.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Reflecting</strong><br>
  Im really enjoying reflecting on my work as it helps me remember what techniques I have used and helps reinforce what  I have learned.</p>
